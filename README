This is a sample Processing (3.1.1) library that uses Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) to build.

Use the "package" command to build the library JAR:
mvn package

The whole repository is designed to be put in your "sketchbook/libraries" directory, but be sure to rename the main directory to match the JAR's name. (I use "aibstestlib".)

This library depends on Andreas Schlegel's (http://www.sojamo.de/) controlP5 library (http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) as an example. Simply downloading it using Processing's "Contribution Manager" (Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library) should work, but be sure to review the pom.xml file if things don't work.
