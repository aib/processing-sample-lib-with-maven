This is a sample Processing (3.1.1) library that uses Apache Maven to build.

Use the "package" command to build the library JAR:
mvn package

The whole repository is designed to be put in your "sketchbook/libraries" directory, but be sure to rename the main directory to match the JAR's name. (I use "aibstestlib".)
